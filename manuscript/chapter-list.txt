## Why?

It would be logical to suppose that as we become increasingly connected and aware of our respective cultures, religions, and belief systems that there would be a trend towards greater tolerance and acceptance. This however does not appear to be the case. Wars on many levels including physical, cultural, and "on terror", "on drugs", etc are as prevalent as ever. 

I want to live in a better / more equal / inclusive / happy world. I'm about to have a child and naturally I suppose this gets you thinking about the future of our planet and the individuals that inhabit it. While of course want the better for my offspring I also passionately want the best for all us. Every single one.

Lastly, as I'll outline in more depth shortly, as the years have rolled by within my life I've reached a form of internal dilemma in so much that I passionately believe all (and I believe all individuals) on the planet are good. Of all the traveling I've been lucky enough to do within my life without fail people have been universally good. And even if they're not (e.g. petty theft, minor violence) it's because they're invariably going through things in their lives that I can't quite comprehend. Those individuals have or had families, were once someone's child, desperate and alone. Fundamentally they were (and still are) just like us. ???

Now of course I have not experienced anything significantly tramatic 

## Focus 

Exploration the forces that are maintaining the status quo. Why are we collectively unable to stop fighting one another? Why are we afraid? Is the fear warranted? 
These are driven by fear (which in turn spurs a desire to acculu) of the unknown...e.g. what will happen after we die.

There's no escaping the fat this will be written through a "Western" "Caucasian" lens. Whether I like it or not, this what I am stuck with and I'll try to be as objective as actively possible. In addition, I completely welcome debate across the board on everything written.

Provoke Consideration & Thought

Blend "live" research and additional media to help reiterate the points and discoveries.

## A Caveat

The truth is I am not a writer. However, I wanted to write this text for a number of reasons, the first and foremost of which is that people are inherently good. Repeat that in your mind a few times. We're born good. We care, we love, we share. We're also of course not perfect.

The truth is I have no idea how this will turn out, even what form it will ultimately take (e.g. book, manuscript, etc)
